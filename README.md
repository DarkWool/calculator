## Actually learning!

At the end of this project I acknowledged that I'm really learning how to do things correctly, in the process of doing this project I have tried to fix all the bugs that have appeared, which required a lot of testing and also, when I finished it a new goal arised: **refactor the code** to make it more readable and fix some problems left.
